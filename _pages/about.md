Hi there. Welcome to my website. My name is Jiwoong Choi, and you can call me Gio. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in [Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu), having earned a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Bachelor of Arts in Economics. My research focuses on **AI and the science of science**, combining large-scale data analysis, causal inference, and LLM-based simulations to uncover the social and epistemic mechanisms underlying scientific discovery and innovation. Please take a look at my [Projects](/publications/) and [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18elLI9OWUe9iell2gJRy6_OydHcbhJZL/view?usp=sharing) (last updated Sep 2025), and feel free to reach out to me.
