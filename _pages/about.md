Hi there. I'm a Master's student in [Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) & Data Science at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu). I am passionate about utilizing data science to analyze social and business issues.

I'm currently working for MSCI as a Sustainability & Climate Research Intern.





Please take a look at my [Projects](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/) and feel free to reach out to me. [giochoi@uchicago.edu](mailto:giochoi@uchicago.edu)
