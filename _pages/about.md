Hi there. I'm an incoming Master's student in [Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu). I love analyzing society through Data Science. 

I'm currently working for MSCI as a ESG Research Intern.





Please take a look at my [Projects](/publications/) and [CV](/cv/) and feel free to reach out to me. [giochoi@uchicago.edu](mailto:giochoi@uchicago.edu)
