I am a Master’s student in [Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu). I am fortunate to work at the [Knowledge Lab](https://knowledgelab.org) with Professor [James Evans](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans) and in the Akcigit Research Team (ART) under Professor [Ufuk Akcigit](https://www.ufukakcigit.com). I work at the intersection of AI, innovation, and organizational decision making, drawing on economics, sociology, and data science. My research uses large-scale graph and text data, causal inference, and LLM-based simulations to understand how ideas emerge, diffuse, and drive innovation across scientific, technological, and organizational systems. Please take a look at my [Projects](/publications/), and feel free to reach out to me. [giochoi@uchicago.edu](mailto:giochoi@uchicago.edu)
